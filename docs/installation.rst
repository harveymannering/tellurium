Installation and Front-ends
===========================

* Supported platforms: |billy3| |jobsey3| |benguin3|

As of March 2021, we currently support Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 for Windows, Mac and Linux.

If you need support for a Python version not already covered, please `file an issue <https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/issues>`_.

New versions of Tellurium no longer support Python 2.7. For those needing Python 2.7 access, previous versions of Tellurium can be installed.

---------------------
Installation Options
---------------------

Tellurium can be used with variety of Python front-ends, for example Spyder, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab. For easy access on Windows we recommend the Windows installer. This will install the Spyder IDE as well as one click access to either Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. 

For Mac, Linux as well Windows platforms, Tellurium can be installed using a standard pip insall as a collection of pip packages: 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install tellurium

We recommend a front-end for end-users who wish to use Tellurium for biological modeling, and the pip packages for developers of other software which uses or incorporates Tellurium.

Front-end 1: Tellurium Notebook
===============================

Tellurium's notebook front-end mixes code and narrative in a flowing, visual style. The Tellurium notebook will be familiar to users of Jupyter, Mathematica, and SAGE. However, unlike Jupyter, Tellurium notebook comes pre-packaged as an app for Windows, Mac, and Linux and does not require any command line installation. This front-end is based on the `nteract project <https://github.com/nteract/nteract>`_.


* Front-end: **Tellurium Notebook**
* Supported platforms: |billy| |jobsey| |benguin|
* Python version: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 64-bit
* **Download:** `here <https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium#front-end-1-tellurium-notebook>`_

    Tellurium notebook offers an environment similar to Jupyter

Front-end 2: Tellurium IDE
==========================

User who are more familiar with MATLAB may prefer Tellurium's IDE interface, which is based on popular programming tools (Visual Studio, etc.). This front-end is based on the `Spyder project <https://www.spyder-ide.org/>`_. Due to stability issues, we recommend Mac users use the Tellurium notebook front-end instead.
